## Introduction
Aframe is an opensource web framework developed by Josh Carpenter that provides developers with tools to create immersive and interactive virtual reality experiences on web .With A-frame developers can build VR experiences using HTML and javascript ,making it more accesible even to those without extensive knowledge of VR programming .

As an independent [open source project](https://github.com/aframevr/), A-Frame has grown to be one of the largest VR communities.
## Key Features


The frameworks oofers a range of  features , including support for 3D models , animations and physics engines , that make it easy to build rich and engaging VR ecperiences . 

Various other features are 

1. VR application is simple: Just drop in a script tag and a-scene. A-Frame will handle 3D boilerplate, VR setup, and default controls. Nothing to install, no build steps.
2. Declarative HTML: HTML is easy to read, understand, and copy-and-paste. Being based on top of HTML, A-Frame is accessible to everyone: web developers, VR enthusiasts, artists, designers, educators, makers, kids.
3. Entity-Component Architecture: A-Frame is a powerful three.js framework, providing a declarative, composable, reusable entity-component structure. HTML is just the tip of the iceberg; developers have unlimited access to JavaScript, DOM APIs, three.js, WebVR, and WebGL.
4. Cross-Platform VR: Build VR applications for Vive, Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Daydream, GearVR, and Cardboard with support for all respective controllers. Don’t have a headset or controllers? No problem! A-Frame still works on standard desktop and smartphones.Although A-Frame supports the whole spectrum, A-Frame aims to define fully immersive interactive VR experiences that go beyond basic 360° content, making full use of positional tracking and controllers.
5. Performance: A-Frame is optimized from the ground up for WebVR. While A-Frame uses the DOM, its elements don’t touch the browser layout engine. 3D object updates are all done in memory with little garbage and overhead. The most interactive and large scale WebVR applications have been done in A-Frame running smoothly at 90fps.
6. Visual Inspector: A-Frame provides a handy built-in visual 3D inspector. Open up any A-Frame scene, hit ctrl + alt + i or ctrl + option + i, and fly around to peek under the hood!
7. Components: Hit the ground running with A-Frame’s core components such as geometries, materials, lights, animations, models, raycasters, shadows, positional audio, text, and controls for most major headsets. Get even further from the hundreds of community components including environment, state, particle systems, physics, multiuser, oceans, teleportation, super hands, and augmented reality.
8. Proven and Scalable: A-Frame has been used by companies such as Google, Disney, Samsung, Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, Amnesty International, CERN, NPR, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, NASA. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oculus, and Samsung have made contributions to A-Frame.

## Use Cases
Can also used to create web based ar experiences using web based AR framework AR.js
